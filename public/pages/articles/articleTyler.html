      <h1 class="section">Tyler, The Creator</h1>
      <p class="section">By Patrick Korytkowski</p>
      <p>Who is Tyler, The Creator? Tyler, The Creator, real name Tyler Gregory Okonma, is an American singer/songwriter who is best known for his work on IGOR, for which he won the award for Best Rap Album of 2020 at the Grammys. However, with that being said, Tyler has gone on to say that IGOR was not a rap album. Tyler released countless albums before IGOR, with them receiving semi-mediocre reviews until the arrival of Flower Boy. Flower Boy saw the first drastic shift in Tyler’s music, with him instead focusing on aspects of love and his emotions instead of the gritty lyrics used in his earlier albums. Immediately following Flower Boy was the prized album that is IGOR, which was then followed by Tyler’s most recent work, with that being Call Me If You Get Lost.
    
        To dig deeper into Tyler and his discography, I will discuss what brought him into the limelight and why he deserves the praise he has received. His previous works of Bastard, Goblin, Wolf, and Cherry Bomb, are all great albums in their own regard, though I will be focusing on his three most current albums. As such, Flower Boy itself is an extended metaphor for his life, and how flowers grow even after difficult situations and circumstances. In support of this message, the artist himself has never explicitly come out as bisexual or gay, though the lyrics within the album are believed by many to be his coming out. Accompanying these lyrics is the idea that Tyler thought the feelings for the same gender would come pass, though never did. With that being said, the openness of Flower Boy was considered to be the artist’s bloom into maturity, where he discussed his real feelings and emotions. This could be seen in the name of tracks off the album, with some examples being “Garden Shed,” “See You Again,” and “911/Mr. Lonely.” These three song titles alone convey the message of the album. “Garden Shed” refers to the emotions he feels for the same gender, “See You Again” tells the tale of Tyler’s depression due to an unrequited love for another, and “911/Mr. Lonely” ends the story with him having to accept the fact that they were not interested in him as a significant other. In all, Flower Boy is an excellent album from Tyler, though it is certainly not his most popular. It was merely a reveal of what was to come, especially since he had finally found his maturity and his own, unique sound.
    
        Following Flower Boy is IGOR, which sees the title character, Igor, who could be considered a stand in for Tyler himself, break up with a male lover for a female. However, he soon realises that he would much rather be with his male partner, and begs for him to accept him once again. To convey this message, the very beginning of the album is a distorted bass sound. This song is similar to other songs in the first half of the album, which all telling the tale of Igor still being in love with his ex lover. As such, the first half of the album contains the song “EARFQUAKE,” which sees Igor convey to the male lover that his life was shook to its very core due to his mistake in pursuing someone he didn’t truly love. The heartbroken and wanting tale progresses throughout the album until the second half of the album. This part of the album sees Tyler come to terms with his mistake and the decision of his ex lover. As such, some track names that stick out are “GONE GONE / THANK YOU,” “I DON”T LOVE YOU ANYMORE,” and “ARE WE STILL FRIENDS?”. With that being said, the final track, “ARE WE STILL FRIENDS?”, in fact, loops perfectly into “IGOR’S THEME,” the first song on the album. This tells the listener that the emotions that Igor has gone through, the relationships he has had and will ever have, can be told in a loop. His love life is a loop. The message of this album can be related to by countless people, and as such, the album saw unbelievable success. Denial always leads to acceptance, though who’s to say how many times that cycle can repeat in one’s life?
    
        Succeeding the popularity of IGOR was going to be impossible, and Tyler knew that, though his efforts in defying this notion could most definitely be seen in his most recent album, which is named Call Me If You Get Lost. However, there is one motif that rears its head in this album as well. As such, this album also has references to Tyler's further heartbreaks after the events of IGOR, though there are significantly less references to it than his two previous albums. Though, with that being said, the name of the album itself could be a reference to the love Igor (Tyler) felt for his ex male lover. He asks him to call if he gets lost, just as he himself got lost in the events of IGOR. Moving on from this idea, the album itself is somewhat chaotic, which is, in itself, a reference to the ongoing pandemic. As such, the true message of the album is somewhat lost in the noise of all the clashing songs, though not all is lost. This is due to Tyler finding his footing in the current state of the world and his countless heartbreaks, ultimately leading to the album promoting self discovery, love, and growth. In fact, this album was also awarded Best Rap Album of 2022 in the Grammys.
    
        In all, Tyler, The Creator is an incredible artist, and he is sure to go even further than he already has. Only time will tell what his next album will bring, though it is sure to be exquisite.
