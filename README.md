## Introduction
 
The Wauconda Doghouse is a progressive web application (PWA) with the purpose of organizing and informing students/parents of Wauconda High School. It removes the unnecessary search of information caused by the school using countless different platforms for all of its information. For students and parents, it's a way of staying up-to-date, but it is also a job for any student council or maintainer members that work on keeping the application current. A tool not only to better put parents into their kids' lives, but to help freshmen adapt to their environment.
