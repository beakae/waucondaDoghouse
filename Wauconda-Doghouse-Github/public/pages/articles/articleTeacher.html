    <h1>Smart Lunch?</h1>
      <p class="section">By Elaine Boyce</p>

      <p> Have you ever wondered what your teachers eat for lunch? Sometimes a person's favorite food or what they eat the most can tell you a lot about them! Well… to give a little insight into some of our teacher's days I asked, for the last time, what some of them usually eat!
        
        
        
        Our first teacher told me they usually enjoy a peanut butter and honey sandwich. I can’t say that I’ve ever had one of those. I’ve never liked honey and I don’t think I will any time soon. I do remember in middle school that we had those sun butter and jelly sandwiches. From what I’ve heard, they were never any good. Maybe they’re similar!
        
        
        
        Our second teacher said they love to have pizza or beef chimichangas, but most of the time they work through their break, so they have to save it for dinner! This is a great example of how hard our teachers work so that we can get all the help that we need. Pizza has been a really popular answer all through this year but chimichangas are a new one! 
        
        
        
        Our final teacher said they have a ham and cheese lettuce wrap, an apple or orange, and usually a yogurt with granola... every single day. I do the same thing. Although I like to change my lunch at least a little bit every once in a while, it usually stays mostly the same. Ham is not my personal favorite choice in lunch meats but everyone is different! 
        
        As always you can see the differences. Of course, this is only a few teachers and even with every issue this year it’s only been a small chunk of the staff. It still gives you a little hint at what our teachers are like. Every teacher is different and always has to do what works for them! Remember just how hard your teachers are working and always treat them with respect! I hope you enjoyed this year’s articles and have a great summer! Best of luck to our seniors as well! </p>
